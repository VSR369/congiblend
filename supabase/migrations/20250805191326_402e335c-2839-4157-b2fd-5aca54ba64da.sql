-- Fix RLS policies for posts table to allow authenticated users to create posts

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view public posts" ON public.posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own posts" ON public.posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own posts" ON public.posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own posts" ON public.posts;

-- Create proper RLS policies for posts
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public posts" 
ON public.posts 
FOR SELECT 
USING (visibility = 'public' OR auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own posts" 
ON public.posts 
FOR INSERT

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own posts" 
ON public.posts 
FOR UPDATE

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own posts" 
ON public.posts 
FOR DELETE
